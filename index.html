            <p>I go to school at Michigan State University. I am studying information science. The topic of information science involves studying how technology and people interact. 
            There are three different focus areas within this major at MSU. These three different focus areas include human-centered technologies, media and information, and information and society. Below is a table outlining the different aspects of these three focus areas. 
            I am studying within the information and society focus area. This focus area focuses on how information and media interact with society. I chose to study within this focus area because, in the future, I am interested in getting a job in cybersecurity. 
            As a student in this major, I am also required to take at least one course outside of my chosen focus area. I chose to take courses in the media and information focus area because the courses in this focus area can also closely relate to cybersecurity.
            The information science major focuses heavily on technology. Although this is the case, students in this major must be able to apply technological concepts to society. This means that students in this major must be able to understand complex issues that society faces, and understand how technology plays a role in these issues. 
            Overall, the information science major at MSU is a unique major.

            <p>I work at the MSU ID Office as a student employee. In the ID Office, I am an information technology assistant. Although the name of my job makes it sound like I just handle making ID cards, I actually do a lot more than that. My job at the ID Office is very tech related. 
            Given that I am an information science major, this job is a perfect fit for me. 
            I do a variety of tasks at my job. First and foremost, I handle the creation and management of ID cards. This task includes a variety of activities. For example, I print new cards, print replacement cards, and troubleshoot issues with ID cards. Next, I handle the management of MSUâ€™s digital credential, the NetID. This task also includes a variety of activities. For example, I create new NetIDs, I help people activate their NetID, and I troubleshoot issues with NetIDs. 
            I also do some smaller tasks at my job. For example, I troubleshoot issues with the printers that are used to print the ID cards. I also sell meal plans to people. 
            I also deal with a variety of people at my job. Many people assume that I only work with students. However, I work with employees, affiliates, and vendors, in addition to students. 
            Overall, this job is related to information science.</p>
